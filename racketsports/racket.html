	<h3> Cricket </h3>
	<br>
	<p>Our sports hall can cater for all our indoor cricket needs, providing full batting and bowling netting and matting for your practice sessions. Prices from as little as £59.60 per hour.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>Indoor cricket nets differ significantly from outdoor nets. They are suspended on an aluminium track way (runners) which are fixed to the ceiling of sports hall or gymnasium.</p> 
	<p>The nets can then drop 8–4 metres to reach the ground, before travelling at least 20 metres laterally, which provides a substantial practise enclosure.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>Indoors nets are commonly multi lane, with 2 or 4 bay nets being particularly common, we have 3. Unlike outdoor cricket nets where the netting is black, indoor nets tend to be white. </p>
	<p>They have a separate canvas screen which enclose the area immediately surrounding the batsman and rise to a height of 3 metres.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>The purpose of this is; 
	<li>
	<ol>The netting to the sides and rear of the batsman has by far the highest work rate.</ol>
	<ol>The canvas is significantly more durable to tradition mesh netting and as such the use of screens improves the life span of the net. </ol>
	<ol>From a simply privacy aspect - the impression of seclusion allows for more focused batsman and reduces the risk of distractions.</ol>
	</li>
	<p>
	<br>
	<p>Indoor cricket nets will be found in almost all sports halls and gyms where the suspension on runners provides a curtain type system for the nets and allows the nets to be pulled in and out of use.</p>
	<p>We have 3 cricket clubs who book them for practice.</p>
